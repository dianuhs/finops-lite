## FinOps Lite — AWS Cost & Tag Hygiene

Goal: a beginner-friendly FinOps tool + reports that help small teams see spend, spot waste, and fix tag hygiene.

Why this exists: Cloud bills are confusing. This project is my learning-by-building path into FinOps: clear cost views, a simple “tag hygiene score,” and quick-win savings recommendations.

Roadmap (MVP)
- [ ] CLI that shows this month’s AWS cost
- [ ] Cost by service (last 30 days)
- [ ] Audit: untagged resources + stopped/unused items
- [ ] “Tag Hygiene Score” (by service + overall)
- [ ] Export: CSV/JSON (PDF later)

Sample Outputs (coming soon)
- screenshots + example reports with dummy data

Notes
- Read-only IAM / least privilege
- No customer data stored in repo
